# 🧊🏺🍸 Sentiment-Analysis 🍸🏺🧊

The program including data cleansing and some criteria to match the requirement. Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the attitude or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. Sentiment analysis typically involves classifying text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral by leveraging machine learning or deep learning models. Before building these models, data cleansing plays a crucial role to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset. Common preprocessing steps include removing noise (such as punctuation, HTML tags, and stopwords), normalizing text through case-folding and lemmatization, and handling duplicated or missing data. These steps help the model understand the underlying patterns more effectively and reduce the risk of misclassification.

Sentiment Analysis — also known as opinion mining — is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on identifying, extracting, and interpreting the emotional tone or subjective information expressed in text, speech, or other communication. Its main purpose is to determine whether the sentiment conveyed is positive, negative, or neutral, but advanced systems may also detect more detailed emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, or sarcasm.

Sentiment analysis works by using various AI techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and linguistic rule-based approaches to analyze words, expressions, and context. It plays a crucial role in real-world applications, including customer feedback evaluation, social media monitoring, brand reputation analysis, product reviews classification, political opinion tracking, and automated customer support. By transforming unstructured text data into structured insights, sentiment analysis helps organizations understand public perception, improve decision-making, and enhance user experience at a large scale.

Classified as below:

- In building a sentiment analysis system, datasets need to meet several criteria to ensure the model's reliability and performance. This includes having a sufficiently large dataset—ideally above 10,000 samples—to allow for better generalization and training stability.
- Additionally, having at least three sentiment classes provides a more nuanced understanding of emotional tone compared to simple binary classification.
- Several training schemes can also be experimented with, such as varying the deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, CNN, Transformer), altering feature extraction methods, or using different data splitting strategies. These experiments allow researchers to evaluate model robustness and identify the most efficient approach.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Criteria of Program 🍸🏺🧊
Criteria of Program refers to the specific standards, requirements, or indicators used to evaluate whether a program is designed and implemented effectively. These criteria help assess the quality of the program’s inputs (resources, participants), processes (methods, activities), outputs (immediate results), and outcomes (long-term impact). By setting clear program criteria, organizations can ensure consistent measurement, maintain quality, and determine whether the program successfully achieves its intended goals.

Criteria of Program are the established standards or requirements used to evaluate the quality, effectiveness, and success of a program in achieving its intended objectives.

**Criteria 1**: Data is the result of independent scraping
You are given the freedom to take data or scraping using the Python programming language from various sources, such as the PlayStore platform, X, Instagram, comments on product ratings on e-commerce, and others. The minimum number of datasets that must be obtained is 3,000 samples.

Classified as below:

**Criteria 2**: Carrying out the stages of feature extraction and data labeling
The method used is free according to the preferences of each participant. This stage is important to prepare data so that it can be further processed in the model training process.

**Criteria 3**: Using a machine learning training algorithm
The choice of this training algorithm must be in accordance with the objectives of the sentiment analysis to be achieved.

**Criteria 4**: The accuracy of the testing set obtained must reach at least 85%
This shows that the model developed has good performance in classifying sentiment from the data provided.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Submission 🍸🏺🧊
The submission consists of developing and evaluating a deep learning–based classification system that fulfills the following criteria:

1. Using deep learning algorithms.
2. Accuracy on training set and testing set above 92%.
3. The dataset has at least three classes.
4. Has a minimum of 10,000 data samples.
5. Conducting 3 different training scheme experiments. These schemes can be distinguished from variations in training algorithms, feature extraction methods, labeling, and data division by selecting at least 2 combinations.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Positive Labels 🍸🏺🧊

In Artificial Intelligence (AI)—especially in classification and machine learning tasks—Positive Labels refer to the class or category that the model is specifically trying to identify or detect.

A positive label is the target outcome that represents the presence of a specific condition, event, or class of interest. It is the “yes” class in a binary classification problem, or one of the target classes in multi-class tasks. The model’s main goal is often to correctly predict when this positive condition exists.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Negative Labels 🍸🏺🧊

In Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, negative labels are classifications assigned to data samples that indicate the absence of a target attribute, an undesirable condition, or a harmful outcome. They are used to distinguish items that should not be selected, recommended, or identified as positive cases.

For example, in sentiment analysis, a negative label may mark sentences expressing dissatisfaction or criticism. In fraud detection, negative labels represent legitimate transactions that should not trigger alerts. These labels are essential for supervised learning models, as they help the algorithm learn the difference between correct and incorrect predictions during training.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Neutral Labels 🍸🏺🧊
Neutral Labels refer to categories or classifications used in a dataset, survey, or labeling task that do not express either a positive or negative stance. They are meant to represent a neutral, objective, or indifferent tone.

In sentiment analysis, for example, a statement like “The meeting starts at 9 AM” is neutral because it simply provides information without emotional tone. In surveys or customer feedback systems, neutral labels capture responses where the participant feels indifferent or undecided. Similarly, in classification tasks like hate-speech detection, a neutral label might categorize text that contains no harmful or targeted language.

Neutral labels are essential because they help improve the accuracy and reliability of models by ensuring that not all data is forced into polarized categories. They reduce bias in automated predictions and allow a more nuanced understanding of real-world human communication, where many expressions fall between clearly positive and negative.
