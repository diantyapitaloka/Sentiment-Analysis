# 🧊🏺🍸 Sentiment-Analysis 🍸🏺🧊

## 🧊🏺🍸 Criteria of Program 🍸🏺🧊

**Criteria 1**: Data is the result of independent scraping
You are given the freedom to take data or scraping using the Python programming language from various sources, such as the PlayStore platform, X, Instagram, comments on product ratings on e-commerce, and others. The minimum number of datasets that must be obtained is 3,000 samples.

**Criteria 2**: Carrying out the stages of feature extraction and data labeling
The method used is free according to the preferences of each participant. This stage is important to prepare data so that it can be further processed in the model training process.

**Criteria 3**: Using a machine learning training algorithm
The choice of this training algorithm must be in accordance with the objectives of the sentiment analysis to be achieved.

**Criteria 4**: The accuracy of the testing set obtained must reach at least 85%
This shows that the model developed has good performance in classifying sentiment from the data provided.

## 🧊🏺🍸 Submission 🍸🏺🧊

1. Using deep learning algorithms.
2. Accuracy on training set and testing set above 92%.
3. The dataset has at least three classes.
4. Has a minimum of 10,000 data samples.
5. Conducting 3 different training scheme experiments. These schemes can be distinguished from variations in training algorithms, feature extraction methods, labeling, and data division by selecting at least 2 combinations.
